F.I.N.D.E.R stands for Filtering Informed Newton-like Derivative-free Evolutionary Recursion. 

It is an iterative optimization scheme which builds on the direct computaion of the diagonal terms in the inverse Hessian matrix, approximated using the principles of stochastic filtering. F.I.N.D.E.R. incorporates an innovative way of utilising these diagonal terms to navigate large dimensional design spaces. It not only ensures rapid advancement in a direction of descent but also explores the neighbourhood to find the fittest particle in every iteration, thereby rendering the algorithm fast and robust.
